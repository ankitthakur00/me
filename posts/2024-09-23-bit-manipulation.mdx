### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

In this article, we will see how bit manipulation could be a real lifesaver for competitive coding as well as for a technical interview.

### So what is Bit manipulation?

Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. This is the process of performing logical operations on bit sequences in order to reach the desired result. Bit manipulation allows us to use these operators to reach certain sequences in a clean and efficient manner, which is just one reason why itâ€™s essential to understand what operators are available and how we can make use of them.

Bit manipulation, in some cases, can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a data structure and can give many-fold speedups, as bit manipulations are processed in parallel, but the code can become more difficult to write and maintain.

At the heart of bit manipulation are the bit-wise operators **&** (and), **|** (or), **~** (not) and **^** (exclusive-or, xor) and shift operators a **&lt;&lt;** b and a **\&gt;&gt;** b.

### Okay So What Next?

Now we will take examples one by one where bit manipulation can be used.

**1\. Count the Number of 1's in Binary Representation of a Number**

```plaintext
int count_one(int n) {
    while(n) {
        n = n&(n-1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
```

**2\. Sum of two Integer** Adding two numbers without using the **+** operator.

Use **^** and **&** to add two integers

```plaintext
int getSum(int a, int b) {
    return b==0? a:getSum(a^b, (a&b)<<1); //be careful about the terminating condition;
}
```

**3\. Missing Number:** Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

For example, Given nums = \[0, 1, 3\] return 2.

```plaintext
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int ret = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        ret ^= i;
        ret ^= nums[i];
    }
    return ret^=nums.size();
}
```

**4\. Largest power of Two:** Find the largest power of 2 (most significant bit in binary form), which is less than or equal to the given number N.

```plaintext
long largest_power(long N) {
    //changing all right side bits to 1.
    N = N | (N>>1);
    N = N | (N>>2);
    N = N | (N>>4);
    N = N | (N>>8);
    N = N | (N>>16);
    return (N+1)>>1;
}
```

**5\. Reverse Bits:** Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

```plaintext
uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
    unsigned int mask = 1<<31, res = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 32; ++i) {
        if(n & 1) res |= mask;
        mask >>= 1;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
}
```

```plaintext
uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
	uint32_t mask = 1, ret = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i < 32; ++i){
		ret <<= 1;
		if(mask & n) ret |= 1;
		mask <<= 1;
	}
	return ret;
}
```

\*\*6. Bitwise & of Number Range \*\* Given a range \[m, n\] where 0 &lt;= m &lt;= n &lt;= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

For example, given the range \[5, 7\], you should return 4.

```plaintext
int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
    int a = 0;
    while(m != n) {
        m >>= 1;
        n >>= 1;
        a++;
    }
    return m<<a; 
}
```

**7\. Number of '1' Bits** Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight#:~:text=The%20Hamming%20weight%20of%20a,string%20of%20the%20same%20length.) ).

```plaintext
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
	int count = 0;
	while(n) {
		n = n&(n-1);
		count++;
	}
	return count;
}
```

```plaintext
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
    ulong mask = 1;
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < 32; ++i){ //31 will not do, delicate;
        if(mask & n) count++;
        mask <<= 1;
    }
    return count;
}
```

**8.Majority Element** Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times. (bit-counting as a usual way, but here we actually also can adopt sorting and Moore Voting Algorithm)

```plaintext
int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    int len = sizeof(int)*8, size = nums.size();
    int count = 0, mask = 1, ret = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
        count = 0;
        for(int j = 0; j < size; ++j)
            if(mask & nums[j]) count++;
        if(count > size/2) ret |= mask;
        mask <<= 1;
    }
    return ret;
}
```

**9\. Single Number** Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one. (Still, this type can be solved by bit-counting easily.) But we are going to solve it by a digital logic design.

```plaintext
//inspired by logical circuit design and boolean algebra;
//counter - unit of 3;
//current   incoming  next
//a b            c    a b
//0 0            0    0 0
//0 1            0    0 1
//1 0            0    1 0
//0 0            1    0 1
//0 1            1    1 0
//1 0            1    0 0
//a = a&~b&~c + ~a&b&c;
//b = ~a&b&~c + ~a&~b&c;
//return a|b since the single number can appear once or twice;
int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
    int t = 0, a = 0, b = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        t = (a&~b&~nums[i]) | (~a&b&nums[i]);
        b = (~a&b&~nums[i]) | (~a&~b&nums[i]);
        a = t;
    }
    return a | b;
}
;
```

**10\. Reversing Bits in Integer:**

```plaintext
x = ((x & 0xaaaaaaaa) >> 1) | ((x & 0x55555555) << 1);
x = ((x & 0xcccccccc) >> 2) | ((x & 0x33333333) << 2);
x = ((x & 0xf0f0f0f0) >> 4) | ((x & 0x0f0f0f0f) << 4);
x = ((x & 0xff00ff00) >> 8) | ((x & 0x00ff00ff) << 8);
x = ((x & 0xffff0000) >> 16) | ((x & 0x0000ffff) << 16);
```

### Wrap Up

Bit Manipulation is used in many ways in different problems, practice problems on different platforms in order to master it.
